For this assignment you are required to build a Single Page Application in React. This assignment examines your understanding of the core React concepts: functional components, props and state.  



As always the choice of content and design is up to you, but it must consist of 3 "pages". No routing should be used in this assignment, we will use state to mock routing.



To achieve a Godkänt grade:



Create a React Single Page Application with:



A home page

Navigation to 2 other "pages"


State is used to conditionally render the content of the current "page"

The pages can have the same layout & structure, or they can be entirely different - the choice is yours.
The content must be different for each page
Each page should have common elements such as a header, page title, navigation, footer etc


Use of components for all elements



Use of props to pass data to elements when necessary

For example the page title should be different for each page - eg different text inside an h1


Each page should have at least one image



Responsive styling



It is completely acceptable to use objects for all your content, though it is not required. You can "hard code" content for each page.



To achieve a Välgodkänt grade:



The use of the map method to render components



Project organization:

Correct directory structure
Correct naming conventions


The use of CSS modules



Correct syntax and naming conventions



Consistent and correct coding style.
