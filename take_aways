ChatGPT can be nice to generate random data for some content info, use it when you need a json to mock around with.

classname={`${classname}`}, style={{prop: stat}}, styles['classname] they all seems legit to get some dynamic going. 

mapping out where to put states is easier when i've put out some html/comp structure. 

make components resuable as much as possible to keep components-count low => easier to keep track on what to use. 

use states as checkers/conditionals

have to use grids more so i learn it better, flex is powerful when you're used to it but feels like grids can solve alot aswell.

new Map() class is powerful but keeping it inside personal projects so i keep up with normal data management aswell within assignments.

timeboxed this assignment to 1day and succeed, starting to get a grip to timebox different tasks.

keep update with vanilla js for some hidden gems such as 'localeCompare'.

exporting functions and trying some stuff to keep jsx files clean. 

did this website inspired from some game-type database if we going to build website for FTG game classes.
